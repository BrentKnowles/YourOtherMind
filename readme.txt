YOUROTHERMIND
=============
Software for organizing text and notes, offline. Framework supports AddIns. Based upon previous iterations, details at www.yourothermind.com.

Storage
-------
Stores data in an sqlite database with simple hooks for exporting data out. Main unit of storage is a Layout, which is a visual canvas allowing notes and images to be placed spatially.

The AddIn system allows new note types to be created.

Installing
----------
Details forthcoming. Package should compile as is but there are issues with the sqlite database I used while developing the software I need to explore.
